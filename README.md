# News-App
It's a news App built on Android Studio. I have used Drawer and webview.
It was developed just for purpose of learning drawer and fragments. 
You can add the link of your local news channels in loadurl of every fragment java
You can also change the names of news channels from dtrings.xml in res-> values
